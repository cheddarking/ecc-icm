# DevFleet (Legacy Shim)

Use this only if you still call `devfleet` procedure. The maintained workflow lives in `$PLUGIN/library/skills/claude-devfleet/SKILL.md`.

## Canonical Surface

- Prefer the `claude-devfleet` skill directly.
- Keep this file only as a compatibility entry point while command-first usage is retired.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`

## Delegation

Apply the `claude-devfleet` skill.
- Plan from the user's description, show the DAG, and get approval before dispatch unless the user already said to proceed.
- Prefer polling status over blocking waits for long missions.
- Report mission IDs, files changed, failures, and next steps from structured mission reports.

ECC-ICM notes: Procedures named above are files, not slash commands: `$PLUGIN/library/procedures/<name>.md`; `$PLUGIN/library/procedures/INDEX.md` says which ecc-icm stage or workspace each maps to. Legacy shims (tdd, verify, e2e, eval, orchestrate, claw and the rest) live under `$PLUGIN/library/legacy-command-shims/commands/`.
